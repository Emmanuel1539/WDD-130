        <p>I am BYU student from Nigeria, West Africa. I recently graduated from a bootcamp as
             a data scientist/ Analyst with over 1 year experience in python, tableau, SQL and Excel. 
             I have passion for a career in IT industry, 
             due to that I wish to leverage my experience as 
             data scientist into creating softwares that can help to 
             solve different industry problems ranging from agriculture to IT to automobile.

        <p> I am currently working for my self as a taxi driver while creating enough time
            to improve my skills in programming and also applying for remote jobs as data 
            scientist/analyst from Europe, America and other parts of the world . 
            I am pursuing a bacherlor's degree in software development at BYU Idaho and looking 
            forward to a brighter, more promising career path.
